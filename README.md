Project Title: E-Motion

Contributors: Milo Shields, Chloe Lam, Amy Yao

E-Motion is a web app that uses a textual emotional analysis API to extract 
emotional sentiment from inputted journal entries. These entries are then presented
graphically on a single page, where users can see on a scale of blue (sad) to
yellow (happy) the emotional content of their sum total of journal entries.

Over time, this homepage shows users emotional trends and encourages an inner
dialogue without demanding a direct or self-reported source of emotional data.

The app is built on Node.js and uses a MongoDB database. It uses the Twinword
Sentiment Analysis API through RapidAPI in order to evaluate the content of
journal entries, and is hosted through Heroku.
